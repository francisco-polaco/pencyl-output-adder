# PENCYL Output Adder
This program will add two columns from two files outputted by PENCYL.

Currently is adding the third column and output that the result in a file with the same formatting as a PENCYL output file, you can check the .dat files for a concrete example.

Since this was used to check some results and derive conclusions the program neither has an UI nor is adaptable without changing the code. So you can change it to fit your needs, particularly tha column to be operated and the operation done to it.
